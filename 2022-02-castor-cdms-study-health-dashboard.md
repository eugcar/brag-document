# Castor CDMS Study Health Dashboard

## Project Duration
**February 2022 - July 2022**

## Project Overview
**Context:**  
Castor CDMS, an Electronic Data Capture (EDC) system, lacked a crucial feature: the ability to provide users with insights into the current status of their studies. This limitation led to the initiation of the Study Health Dashboard project, aimed at giving users clear visibility into study progress and enabling informed decision-making.

**Objective:**  
Develop a comprehensive study health dashboard that visually represents key data within the application, allowing users to easily monitor study status and take necessary actions based on real-time insights.

## My Role and Contributions
As the sole backend software engineer on this project, I was responsible for the entire backend implementation. I collaborated closely with Nicolas Barrera, the frontend module owner, and Nienke Tjalma, the Product Owner, to ensure the dashboard met user needs. My role involved deep analysis of the business domain to accurately extract and process the necessary data while adhering to complex constraints.

**Key Actions:**
- Designed and implemented the backend architecture using a Request-Generator-Response pattern, leveraging a factory to dynamically retrieve the appropriate generator based on the request object.
- Applied a series of decorators to the request object, centralizing key functionalities such as visibility restrictions and response caching.
- Identified and addressed potential performance issues during development, with several optimizations made prior to the first major release.
- Delivered an elegant, scalable backend solution that has been continuously updated and extended, supporting future enhancements on both frontend and backend sides.

## Outcome and Impact
- Successfully launched the Study Health Dashboard, providing users with clear, actionable insights into their study data.
- Laid the groundwork for ongoing improvements, ensuring that the dashboard could be easily extended as new requirements emerged.
- Enhanced user satisfaction by enabling real-time monitoring and decision-making within the Castor CDMS platform.
